# Sorta Sum

Have the user input two integer values between 1 to 20 (inclusive). Create a sortaSum method that takes the two integers as parameters and adds / sums the two integers together. return their sum to the main method as an integer. However, sums in the range 10 to 19 inclusive, are forbidden, so in that case just return 20.

NOTE: Check that the user enters a number between 1 to 20, otherwise prompt them again.
